## Conclusion

In this project, we were able to create a model that accomplished our goal to learn the parameters of the simulated galaxy images and accurately predict, given a sample of mock galaxy images. The architecture of the unet model was able to learn the parameters of the simulated images well, with four out of the five parameters (flux, Sersic radius, g1, and g2) showing minimal prediction error. The Sersic index was consistently more difficult to predict, and represents an area for model improvement. 

## Future Work

For future work and possible extensions to this project, we feel that it would be interesting to continue testing the robustness of our unet model. This would involve simulating more images with varying parameters, or increasing noise, and adjusting our model as needed. It would be interesting to be able to test the limits of our model.

Overall, we very much enjoyed learning about galaxies in this project module. We felt that this was a very interesting problem to investigate, and this project was a nice hands-on way to explore a variety of neural network tuning methods.
